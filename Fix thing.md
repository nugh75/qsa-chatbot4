Things to fix
- Decide how to handle welcome and guidance.
Currently there's a section in personality but the program manages them from outside. Maybe this needs to be removed

**Problem explanation:**
This appears to be a technical issue with a chatbot system where there's a conflict between how welcome messages and user guidance are handled. The problem is that there's a "personality" section (likely in configuration) that defines welcome/guidance behavior, but the main program is overriding this by managing these features externally. This creates inconsistency and suggests the personality section configuration might be redundant and should be removed to avoid confusion.
